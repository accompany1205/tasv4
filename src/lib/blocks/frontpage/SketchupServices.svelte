		<h4 class="py-4 text-2xl"> Interior Design </h4>
		<p>
			Sketchup is a great tool for interior design. Place materials on 3d shapes to recreate a
			space, and see it from inside the model. Sketchup is unique in that it is fully
			customizable. There are no limitations to what you can create.

		<h4 class="my-4 text-3xl font-black"> About Sketchup </h4>
		<p class="pb-4 text-lg">
			Sketchup is a great visualization program that puts the power of 3D modeling in the
			hands of everyone. What was once only possible with years of technical training, can now
			be learned in just a few lessons. Sketchup is great for kids too. We have taught all
			ages from 10 to 75.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4 text-lg">
			Sketchup allows users to transfer an idea, into a visual 3D model, and eventually into
			reality using digital manufacturing processes like 3D printers and CNC machines. You can
			also use your model for design exploration and construction documentation for
			traditional building methods. Models created in Sketchup can also be brought into
			virtual reality. You can explore your future home with a VR headset! Sketchup is a
			Universal 3D Modeling Program with Countless Applications. Users can create
			architectural structures, virtual 3D gaming worlds, 3D printed objects, 3D Art and more.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4 text-lg">
			Anything that can be imagined, can be created. Imagine drawing or doodling an idea on a
			piece of paper. Now imagine doodling with virtual geometric 3D shapes: cubes, cylinders,
			spheres, cones, domes, and more. Now you can doodle quickly in 3D. The possibilities for
			creation are endless.
