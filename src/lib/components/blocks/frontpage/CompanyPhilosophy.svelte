			<p>
				Professionals these days are sitting alone and staring at their computers. They
				spend years searching online for tools that will increase their workplace
				efficiency. They hunt through forums and watch lengthy videos, trying to find the
				right pieces of information. Sometimes they just have one small question that would
				take a person two minutes to answer, but customer support lines are a thing of the
				past. Big companies will direct you to an FAQ that will hardly begin to answer your
				question.

			<h4 class="py-4 text-2xl">Bring Back the Human Connection</h4>
			<p>
				We strive to bring human connection back to the work environment. Our tutors work
				directly with you to solve your problems, similar to the way an apprentice works
				hand-in-hand with a skilled professional. Screen-share technologies like Zoom have
				allowed us to work together in real time. We can see each others’ screens and
				cursors. We can switch from one screen to another to easily share information. We
				can even turn on our webcam for a more human interaction.

			<p>
				Sometimes our clients want to learn a program from beginning to end, sometimes they
				completely hand over the services to us, and other times they want something in
				between. Some clients want to be able to use the program on a basic level, and let
				us do the hard stuff. Some clients want to co-work with us. They supervise our work
				and make sure their artistic vision is being realized. Along the way, they may learn
				some tools of the trade. By the end of the process, some clients are able to ween
				themselves completely off of our services and are empowered to do the work
				themselves. If they get stuck or behind on a deadline, they use us as a lifeline.
				They can call anytime, even if it’s just a 10 minute question, we are here to help.
