				The process of learning 1-on-1 with a live tutor lets you participate in the
				learning. You get to talk more than you would in a lecture hall. You can immediately
				repeat a concept back in your own words, ask a clarifying question, or demonstrate a
				concept back to your tutor to make sure you got it right.â€‹

			<h4 class="py-4 text-2xl">Efficient</h4>
			<p>
				You could spend a whole semester driving to a local college to learn skills that may
				not apply to your specific workflow. Alternatively, you can sit in the comfort of
				your home, save driving expenses, and learn only the tools you need from a personal
				tutor. Whether you are a first time user or seasoned professional, we can prepare
				the appropriate lessons and find custom solutions to your specific problems.

		<div class="card w-full max-w-xs flex-shrink-0 pl-4">
			<h4 class="py-4 text-2xl">Recordable</h4>
			<p>
				No need to take notes! We can record the lesson so you can play it back at your own
				speed later. This recording is yours to keep.

			<h4 class="py-4 text-2xl">Fun</h4>
			<p>
				Having a direct learning partner is a much better experience than learning alone.
				You can talk out the problems and practice together. Bringing the human
				conversational element back to online learning is refreshing. Call us anytime if you
				need help!
